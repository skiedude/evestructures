Notification Manager:
 - new way to handle notifications to be more dynamic?
    * Maybe a switch case and pass in the notification type
    * maybe we just make a notification for each type
 - Test webhook button
 - Check boxes to enable/disable types of notifications Per character
   -- Requires webhook to be there to see these options
   -- just under the webhook box, one update to rule them all?
    * Low fuel
    * unacnhoring almost started/ending
    * shield state change
      -- table to track this?
    * extraction started
    * extraction ready
    * extraction auto fractured
  - Notification history view?
    * tracked in a table, user_id/character_id keys
  - One job to check all of these? Or seperate jobs
  - move webhook from characters table to notification_managers table
